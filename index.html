  <h2>Experience</h2>
  <h3>Consulting Intern</h3>
  <h4>Guidehouse</h4>
  <h5>June 2020 - August 2020</h5>
  <p>Working in the Energy, Sustainability, and Infrastructure sector I supported a project management team overseeing our clientâ€™s operation by auditing and editing client deliverables. I identified several key internal processes that would benefit from automation and subsequently wrote automation codes to boost efficiency throughout the remainder of the project. I also participated in media research and briefed leadership on data analysis and imputation as well as the associated media risks and controversies.</p>
  <h3>Student Consultant</h3>
  <h4>Lockheed Martin</h4>
  <h5>February 2020 - May 2020</h5>
  <p>I worked on a 5-member team connected to Lockheed Martin through the QUEST Honors Program at UMD to improve signal-processor production efficiency. My team reduced the number of production delays by 850 hours per new program, developed a plan to improve operations through data collection and analysis, and recommended process changes to improve team communication.</p>
  <h3>Opinion Columnist</h3>
  <h4>The Diamondback</h4>
  <h5>August 2018 - August 2019</h5>
  <p>I wrote weekly opinion articles for The Diamondback, an award-winning independent student newspaper at UMD. I covered a variety of topics, focusing primarily on local environmental, political, and humanitarian issues. I gathered and analyzed data from official sources in order to inform my articles and bring light to important issues.</p>
  <h3>Electrical Engineering Intern</h3>
  <h4>Comparative Innovations</h4>
  <h5>January 2018 - April 2019</h5>
  <p>As an intern full-time over the summer and part-time during the school year, I designed, built, and programmed key circuitry to increase technological functionality. I developed virtual instruments using LabVIEW and LINX to operate electronics and collect data. I also used field testing and data analysis to optimize power systems.</p>
